# Credit Card Default
Under this project we were given a credit card dataset for 30000 customers, which contained the past 6 months credit history of customers. Our task was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the Data, derive valuable insights from the data and build a machine learning model that can predict whether the customer will default next month or not.
